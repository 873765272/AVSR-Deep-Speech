## Please Note

All the above scripts are taken from the repository [tensorfow-rbm](https://github.com/meownoid/tensorfow-rbm) (there may be slight code modifications but, the mostly the code is same). I want to thank the author for the work. Please visit the [repository](https://github.com/meownoid/tensorfow-rbm), for further details.

These scripts are required for defining our Restricted Boltzmann Machines (RBMs). We require three kind of RBMs (as suggested in the [paper(training section)](https://ibug.doc.ic.ac.uk/media/uploads/documents/petridispantic_icassp2016.pdf)):

* Bernoulli-Bernoulli RBM 
* Gaussian-Bernoulli RBM
* Bernoulli-Gaussian RBM

We will be using RBMs for layer wise pretraining of our deep autoencoder.
